# 🍎 Phaser Apple Game

Welcome to my first game project, built with **Phaser**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**! 🎮  
This project was inspired and guided by the tutorials of the amazing YouTuber [LowPolyPrincess](https://www.youtube.com/@LowPolyPrincess).

## 🎯 The Game

Your mission: **Collect at least 30 apples before time runs out to win!**  
🍏 **Golden apples** are worth bonus points, but beware of the **rotten apples**, as they will reduce your score.

💡 **Can you beat the timer?** Good luck and have fun! 🚀
